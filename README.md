This a backend project using spring boot developing the e-commerce website for adding products into cart. 

We have implemented the following functions:

1. Created REST APIs for adding,updating and deleting products

2. Created REST APIs for customers to add their desired products into cart, update them or delete them all

3. Calculated the distance between the consumer pin code and the product's Warehouse.

4. Calculated the total weight of the products in each cart and so calculated the total price of each cart. 

5. Calculated the total price to be paid by customer by applying discount on total price and adding shipping charge based on the cart's weight.
